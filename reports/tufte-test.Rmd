```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tufte)
library(tidyverse)
x <- " pickles"
```

Here is some normal text with inline code: 2+3=`r 2+3``r x`  

\vspace{10pt}

```{r block, fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat('Here is a margin code block with code-generated text and a plot.')
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(mpg, disp)) + geom_point()
cat('The text stays in the main body.')
```

\vspace{10pt}

I can combine text and code in a footnote^[2+3=`r 2+3` \newline\vspace{10pt}], but I get footnote numbering, which I don't want.

\begin{marginfigure}
Here is a margin figure with inline code that does work: 2+3=`r 2+3` \newline\vspace{10pt}
\end{marginfigure}


`r tufte::margin_note('This is a margin note. If I try to include inline code in it, I get an error because it "failed to tidy R code in chunk"')`  

How about a list:

> - first
> - second
> - third
