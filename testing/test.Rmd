\indent This forest management plan is a blueprint for responsible land stewardship.  It is the result of a planning process that incorporated an assessment of the history and current conditions on the property, consideration of the various courses of future development that the forest could follow, and discernment as to which outcomes best suit my particular objectives.

#Introduction

This plan Covers the ten year period from `r if_else(month < 4, year, year+1)` to `r if_else(month < 4, year+9, year+10)`. It lays out the near- and medium-term actions that should guide the development of the `r forestname` Forest.  It also qualifies the property for Use Value Appraisal (UVA) and commensurate reduction in property taxes.^[Further information about UVA and current valuations can be found at the Vermont Tax Department's website: https://tax.vermont.gov/property-owners/current-use. \vspace{20pt}]  Owners participating in the Use Value Appraisal program are obliged to manage their property according to the plan and to make any reasonable investments for improvement that the plan recommends.^[UVA management plan standards are determined by the Department of Forests, Parks, & Recreation and are available at https://fpr.vermont.gov/forest/your_woods/use_value_appraisal or through a County Forester.]  Its recommendations were developed in accordance with the principles and practices of scientifically sound forestry, as described in the relevant management guidelines, textbooks and academic journals.

#Property Description

`r if_else(sum(stands$acres_legal) == glacres, "All", paste("Some", round(100*sum(stands$acres_legal)/glacres), "percent", sep = " "))` of the `r glacres` acre `r forestname` property is productive forestland that will be managed according to this plan. Its elevations range from `r elevationmin` to `r elevationmax` feet above mean sea level. `r watertext` `r boundariestext` Soils, forest health, and other pertinent topics are discussed in the individual stand area descriptions that follow.

Presented below are detailed stand-by-stand descriptions of the forest, the long-term structural, compositional and functional goals for each stand, and the near-term silvicultural treatments or management activities that have been prescribed to advance each stand toward those goals.  The data presented in the following pages was obtained from a field examination of the property in `r lubridate::month(month, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)` of `r year`.  General conditions were assessed qualitatively in conjunction with quantitative sampling.  Observational notes and sample summary statistics together provide the basis for the area descriptions and management recommendations. All sampling was done using a systematic sample and variable radius plots. In stands with uneven-aged structures, all trees 6" dbh and larger were measured in each plot. In stands with even-aged structures, all main-canopy trees were measured in each plot.

When contractors are used to implement silvicultural prescriptions, they should be highly skilled, properly equipped, fully insured, and closely supervised.  A professional forester should prepare and administer commercial treatments, and logging operations should be timed to coincide with favorable weather conditions (working on wet soils only when they are frozen, for instance) and favorable timber markets.  Use Value Appraisal program guidelines allow any management activities prescribed in this plan to be carried out up to three years before or after the date indicated.  Landowners in the Use Value Appraisal program must file a Forest Management Activity Report with the County Forester by February 1^st^ if any commercial logging occurred in the previous year. 

The property should be reinventoried in `r if_else(month < 4, year+9, year+10)` and the findings brought to bear on a reassessment of the goals and strategies proposed in this plan, leading to a formal management plan update.  At any point over the course of this management period, this plan may be updated to incorporate new information and to reflect any new thoughts, concerns or considerations on the part of the family or the foresters helping to manage their land.

##Long-term management system

**Group selection**^[Leak, W.B., M.Yamasaki, and R. Holleran. 2014. Silvicultural Guide for Northern Hardwoods in the Northeast. USDA For. Serv. Gen. Tech. Rep. NRS-132.] 

A group selection system (in which groups of trees are harvested at each entry) will maintain the uneven-aged structure that is present, generate regular logging revenue, and provide early successional habitat for grouse and other species.  Approximately 1/6^th^ of the stand area will be harvested in groups of 1/2 to 2 acres, every 15 years or so. This will allow groups to grow about 90 years before they are harvested. While these groups are on the small side for grouse habitat, they will be more aesthetically pleasing and will regenerate a diverse mix of hardwood and softwood species. Target diameters will be specific to species as follows: 24 inches for white pine, red spruce, sugar maple, yellow birch, and black cherry; 18 inches for other commercial hardwoods (with exceptions allowed for all veneer quality hardwood stems); 18 inches for hemlock; and 14 inches for fir.

Tending will be carried out in immature groups at each entry as well (those not being harvested), to promote the growth of the trees with the highest value-growth potential.

An uncut buffer should be maintained along Valley Lake and Little Dog Pond to protect water quality and for the coniferous cover it will provide for overwintering grouse.

##Silvicultural prescription

**Group selection harvest**^[Leak, W.B., M.Yamasaki, and R. Holleran. 2014. Silvicultural Guide for Northern Hardwoods in the Northeast. USDA For. Serv. Gen. Tech. Rep. NRS-132.]   
\noindent __Year:__ 2022  

About 1/6^th^ of the stand (6 acres) and not more than 1/5^th^ (7 acres) should be harvested in groups that are 1/2 to 2 acres in size.  These groups should be located throughout the stand, and should be focused on releasing desirable advanced regeneration, removing concentrations of unacceptable growing stock, and triggering the establishment of new regeneration. Species targeted for release or establishment include sugar maple, spruce, yellow birch, black cherry, and some paper birch and aspen.

In the matrix between these group openings, a crown thinning should reduce the stocking to about 90 ft^2^/acre. This is a bit below b-line on the mixedwood stocking guide, but the stand is already 2/3^rd^ hardwoods and we expect the thinning to push it further in that direction (b-line for a hardwood stand is about 70ft^2^/acre). Sugar maple, yellow birch, and spruce should be favored for retention, but the focus will be on removing unacceptable  and lower quality growing stock and releasing the stems with the highest value-growth potential.  

No group openings should be cut within 100 feet of the ponds or within 50 feet of streams, and only very limited thinning should be done in that area. In areas where the ground slopes steeply to the water, the buffer should be extended to prevent erosion and water sedimentation. Heavy equipment should be excluded from the pond buffers as well, except along the existing access road.
