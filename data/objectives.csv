1,"n hash Conservation n The ecological functioning, productive capacity and biological diversity of the forest resource should be maintained or improved over time so as to provide opportunities for the current or future landowners to continue to enjoy and use the property.  A management strategy that is sustainable in the long-term and viable in the short- and medium-terms offers a strong measure of protection against future development or conversion."
2,"n hash Resilience n The overarching objective of management is to bolster the resilience, dynamism, and adaptive capacity of the forest as a component of a complex ecological system.  This guiding principle is motivated by a commitment to maintaining the productivity and ecological function of the land even in the face of accelerating environmental change.  Specifically, management planning should directly address the threats global climate change poses—increased risks of drought, prolonged heat waves, catastrophic ice and wind storms, pest irruptions, flooding—and minimize the risks associated with unplanned forest cover loss or degradation.  The primary risk mitigation strategies operate across spatial scales: property-wide, the aim is to develop or further entrench the attributes associated with complex adaptive systems, including diversity, connectedness, and diffused system boundaries; at the stand-scale resilience emerges from the functional redundancy and complementarity of complex arrangements of species, age-classes, and stand structures; at the sub-stand scale, attention should be directed toward improving the health and vigor of individual trees to best position them to resist or recover from individual stressors."
3,"n hash Ecological integrity, wildlife habitat, and biodiversity n Management should prioritize the protection of critical ecological functions, water resources, and threatened or rare plant and wildlife communities.  Wetlands and stream-side riparian zones should be carefully delineated and protected; and management should give consideration to the habitat needs of native wildlife populations and to the relationship between the property, its neighbors and the larger landscape they are nested within.  Management should be informed by and aim to improve landscape diversity, wildlife travel corridors, and habitat connectivity.  Locally under-represented habitat types should be identified and promoted.  Stand scale and sub-stand scale management should focus on developing or maintaining species-specific habitat needs, such as nesting sites, cover, mast production, preferred browse or other unique structural and compositional requirements."
4,"n hash Timber management n Management should provide regular returns from timber harvesting. Long-term value growth is provided by maintaining full site occupancy with investment-grade stems: healthy trees capable of producing high quality sawtimber or veneer and worth retaining in the stand until they reach their full, site- and species-specific target diameters. Tree species which yield sought-after, high-value wood should be promoted within each stand or, when regenerating a new stand, attention should be paid to providing the stand conditions which favor the establishment of those species. At a property-wide scale, a variety of species should be maintained, providing options for seizing future market opportunities and a hedge against species-specific market depreciation. Among desired species, additional preference should be given to individual trees of sufficient vigor and grade-potential for strong future value growth. Consideration of economic efficiency should inform the timing and coordination of infrastructure investments and stand maintenance, improvement and harvest operations."
5,"n hash Wood production and timber management n The forest should be able to sustainably provide a reliable supply of fuelwood, fencing and building materials, and valuable, high quality timber, either as sources of revenue or for consumption or utilization directly on the farm or in the community.  Long-term value growth is provided by maintaining full site occupancy with healthy trees capable of producing high quality sawtimber and veneer.  Tree species which yield sought-after, high-value wood shall be promoted within each stand or, when regenerating within a stand, attention shall be paid to providing the conditions which favor the establishment of those species.  At a property-wide scale, a variety of species shall be maintained to provide opportunities to exploit future market opportunities and as a hedge against species-specific market depreciation.  Among desired species, additional preference shall be given to individual trees of sufficient vigor and grade-potential for strong future value growth.  Consideration of economic efficiency should inform the timing and coordination of infrastructure investments and stand maintenance, improvement and harvest operations."
6,"n hash Maple sap production n Sustainable sap production is achieved at the tree and the stand levels.  Individual tree growth must be fast enough that tap holes and the associated stain column are fully healed over with “white wood” before another tap is located in the same area of the trunk.  Conservative tapping guidelines have been designed to prevent unsustainable tapping, but they ultimately depend on healthy trees putting on vigorous growth.  At the stand level, sustainability is realized through the continuous establishment and recruitment of regeneration and eventual development of a true, all-aged structure in the sugarbush."

8,"n hash Scenery, recreation, and exploration n Conscientious management can create or maintain a landscape that is attractive, accessible and conducive to reflection, exploration and appreciation.  Attractiveness can be managed for by fostering diversity within the landscape: accelerating the growth and development of the most receptive individual trees in some places; maintaining the look, feel and accompanying privacy provided by a dense forest in other places; and elsewhere creating occasional vistas out from the forest and improvements in depth of visual penetration within it.  Attentive maintenance of existing roads and trails and thoughtful improvements to the trail network should facilitate the satisfying use of the property, creating an appropriate balance between access and connectedness, on the one hand, while preserving places of refuge and sanctuary, on the other.  A system of roads and trails of various sizes, suited for various purposes, and interconnected with a broader trail network, provide for both enjoyable recreation and efficient operations.  An inviting, easily accessed working forest should also encourage study and intellectual exploration, allowing an interested land owner to become increasingly knowledgeable about their land and positioned to contribute meaningfully to its ongoing management."
9,"n hash Amenity values n Conscientious management can create or maintain a landscape that is attractive, accessible and conducive to reflection, exploration and appreciation.  Attractiveness can be managed for by fostering diversity within the landscape: promoting the growth and development of the most appealing individual trees in some places; maintaining the look, feel and accompanying privacy provided by a dense forest in other places; and elsewhere creating occasional vistas out from the forest and improvements in depth of visual penetration within it.  Carefully planned and deliberately located infrastructure should facilitate the satisfying use of the property, creating an appropriate balance between access and connectedness, on the one hand, and places of refuge and sanctuary, on the other.  A system of roads and trails of various sizes, suited for various purposes, and interconnected with a broader trail network, provide for both enjoyable recreation and efficient operations."
10,"n hash Visual and noise buffering n Areas should be identified where forest cover could or does provide a valuable privacy screen and/or noise buffer. In these areas, care should be taken to maintain adequate stocking for existing buffers to function effectively; or to create conditions that foster rapid tree growth so new buffers can become established quickly."
11,"n hash Grouse habitat n Areas of early successional forest should be maintained on the property by regularly cutting regeneration openings. Early successional forests have become much less common in the region, and grouse and other species depend on the herbaceous growth, soft mass, and low cover that they provide. Larger openings tend to make better habitat for grouse; especially if aspens and soft mass bearing trees can be regenerated. Fallen logs should be retained in openings to provide drumming perches. Habitat quality declines drastically some 15 to 20 years after cutting, so new openings should be cut regularly; older openings nearby will still be useful to grouse for nesting. Ideally, areas of dense coniferous cover should be maintained near the openings as well, to provide winter cover.    "
12,"n hash Food production and agricultural integration n The interface between open, agricultural fields and closed, fully stocked woodlands presents unique opportunities to exploit synergistic dynamics and create novel productive environments.  The various arrangements and potential benefits are broad: from shade and wind protection provided by a tree line at a field's edge or in a “living barn”; to complex silvopasture systems which grow forest products and livestock at the same time on the same area of land in a way that produces more of each than if they been spatially segregated; to fruit and nut orchards and integrated food forests.  These and other systems should be pursued in a way that maximizes opportunities for experimentation and learning, and that minimizes the interference with other ongoing agricultural production and forest management activities."
